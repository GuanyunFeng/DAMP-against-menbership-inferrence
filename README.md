The primary environment is Python 3.7 and you need to install pytorch==1.6.0, sklearn==1.0.2, opacus (for differential privacy, comment out the import of this library if you do not use differential privacy).
## Dataset
In this experiment, we used six data sets of MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, TEXAS, LOCATIONS, and PURCHASE for the experiment. Among them, MNIST contains 10 classifications, LOCATIONS contains 30 classifications, and TEXAS, PURCHASE and CIFAR100 contain 100 classifications.
